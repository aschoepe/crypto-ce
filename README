crypto-ce consists of two independent html custom elements


crypted-data is a container that contains encrypted data:

- "algorithm" is not needed at the moment, because only AES-GCM is implemented yet
- "group" combines a group of elements that can be decrypted with the same password at the same time
- "salt" is the salt (base64url encoded) used when the data was encrypted
- "content" the encrypted data (base64url encoded)

  <crypted-data algorithm="AES-GCM" group="0" salt="dTe2oVxNnG4btg">
    aINh0EZxbLlD9wXdCVqlJYojCsDAL6fhzUpJ8LrPVQ
  </crypted-data>


crypted-encoder is an element which can be included on an html-page to encrypt data:

  <crypted-encoder></crypted-encoder>
